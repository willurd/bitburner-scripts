Alpha and Omega

Then we saw a new heaven and a new earth, for our first heaven and earth had gone away, and our sea was no more. And we saw a new holy city, new Aeria, coming down out of this new heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And we heard a loud voice saying, 'Behold, the new dwelling place of the Gods. We will dwell with them, and they will be our people, and we will be with them as their Gods. We will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.'

And once were were seated on the throne we said 'Behold, I am making all things new.' Also we said, 'Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.' And we said to you, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. The one who conquers will have this heritage, and we will be his God and he will be our son. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, for it is the second true death.'
