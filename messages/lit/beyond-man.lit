Beyond Man

Humanity entered a 'transhuman' era a long time ago. And despite the protests and criticisms of many who cried out against human augmentation at the time, the transhuman movement continued and prospered. Proponents of the movement ignored the critics, arguing that it was in our inherent nature to better ourselves. To improve. To be more than we were. They claimed that not doing so would be to go against every living organism's biological purpose: evolution and survival of the fittest.

And here we are today, with technology that is advanced enough to augment humans to a state that can only be described as posthuman. But what do we have to show for it when this augmentation technology is only available to the so-called 'elite'? Are we really better off than before when only 5% of the world's population has access to this technology? When the powerful corporations and organizations of the world keep it all to themselves, have we really evolved?

Augmentation technology has only further increased the divide between the rich and the poor, between the powerful and the oppressed. We have not become 'more than human'. We have not evolved from nature's original design. We are still the greedy, corrupted, and evil men that we always were.
