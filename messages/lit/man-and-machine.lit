Man and the Machine

In 2005 Ray Kurzweil popularized his theory of the Singularity. He predicted that the rate of technological advancement would continue to accelerate faster and faster until one day machines would be become infinitely more intelligent than humans. This point, called the Singularity, would result in a drastic transformation of the world as we know it. He predicted that the Singularity would arrive by 2045. And yet here we are, more than three decades later, where most would agree that we have not yet reached a point where computers and machines are vastly more intelligent than we are. So what gives?

The answer is that we have reached the Singularity, just not in the way we expected. The artifical superintelligence that was predicted by Kurzweil and others exists in the world today - in the form of Augmentations. Yes, those Augmentations that the rich and powerful keep to themselves enable humans to become superintelligent beings. The Singularity did not lead to a world where our machines are infinitely more intelligent than us, it led to a world where man and machine can merge to become something greater. Most of the world just doesn't know it yet.
