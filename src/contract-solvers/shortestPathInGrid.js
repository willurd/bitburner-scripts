// Shortest Path in a Grid
// You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 10 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


// You are located in the top-left corner of the following grid:

//   [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1],
//    [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],
//    [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0],
//    [0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1],
//    [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
//    [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]]

// You are trying to find the shortest path to the bottom-right corner of the grid, but there are obstacles on the grid that you cannot move onto. These obstacles are denoted by '1', while empty spaces are denoted by 0.

// Determine the shortest path from start to finish, if one exists. The answer should be given as a string of UDLR characters, indicating the moves along the path

// NOTE: If there are multiple equally short paths, any of them is accepted as answer. If there is no path, the answer should be an empty string.
// NOTE: The data returned for this contract is an 2D array of numbers representing the grid.

// Examples:

//     [[0,1,0,0,0],
//      [0,0,0,1,0]]

// Answer: 'DRRURRD'

//     [[0,1],
//      [1,0]]

// Answer: ''
